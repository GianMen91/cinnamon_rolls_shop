"Cinnamood - Cinnamon Rolls Shop" is an application I developed with **Flutter** that uses **Provider** for state management.
It is inspired by the renowned [Cinnamood](https://cinnamood.de) shop in Berlin and brings the delectable experience of exploring and virtually shopping for mouth-watering cinnamon rolls.
The app captures the essence of the Cinnamood shop, featuring a user-friendly interface, a diverse product catalog, and a dynamic cart system.
I used **Hero Widget** for creating smooth, visually appealing transitions between screens by animating a shared element.
**CI/CD** with **GitHub Actions**.

Additionally, the app's **UI components** are designed and tested using **Widgetbook**, a tool that enables efficient and structured UI testing and documentation, providing an overview of individual widgets and their behavior in different scenarios.
